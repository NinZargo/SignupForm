# Brunel Sailing Sign-Up Form

Using React + Vite + Supabase + MatierialUI

Mainly a project to take my first steps into full-stack development but with the side benefit of solving the issue of my not-so-smooth setup using Microsoft Forms and PowerBI

Do not expect the finest programming, many guides and AI are used to explain things and debug so the coding style is interesting.
